Goals for this project:
Learn how to:

bulletpoint implement API's using fetch and axios
bulletpoint create Dark Mode
receive file (a font in this case) and apply it on the quote

newQuote isn't working properly, it's always showing the previous "quoteAuthor" image
This is happening because

1. both fetches are happening at the same time, so maybe the image "changes" before the quoteAuthor does
2. It's some scope problem
